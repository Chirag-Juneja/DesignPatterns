# Design Patterns in Python

## Gamma Categorization

### Creational Patterns
* Deal with creation (construction) of objects
* Explicit (Constructor) vs Implicit (Dependency Injection)
* Wholesale (single statement) vs Piecewise(step-by-step)

### Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure 
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
* Stress the importance of good API design

### Behavioral Patterns
* They are all different and have no centeral theme.
